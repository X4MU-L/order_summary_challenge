### Continued development

- Flexbox - Flexbox is currently one of my greatest challenge as of late and I am hoping to get directions on where to learn more on this and develop.


- Semantic and Assibility HTML Markup - Obviously a very great challenge i hope to overcome.

- CSS Frameworks - Last but not the least i look forward to making use of *CSS frameworks* in my code even though i'm looking forward on improving greatly in my CSS skills before making use of frameworks.
